## Why this reading
I picked this article because it tackles a very real problem for people who often face harassment and doxxing in their lines of work, and it focuses on a concrete response rather than just sounding the alarm. The story explains how the Public Service Alliance built a marketplace that connects verified public servants to discounted services for data removal, threat monitoring, legal help, and even wellness support, and it also shows why this matters by outlining how data brokers fuel targeted abuse and how weak rules make opt outs hard to maintain. I like that the approach is practical, vendor neutral, and meant to be nonpartisan, and I think the idea of issuing access codes and negotiating bulk discounts is a smart design pattern that other high risk groups could reuse. My takeaway for software work is that safety features should be treated as core product work, not add ons, which means building clear eligibility checks, strong privacy guarantees, and update paths that keep data off people search sites over time.
